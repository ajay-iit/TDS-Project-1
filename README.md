## This is the first project in TDS whch is about GitHub Users in city Austin

# 1. Data Collection
The data is scraped from the GitHub API using pandas code, which gave 2 files,
users.csv (contains data about GitHub users in Austin with over 100 followers and their repositories),and repositories.csv.

# 2. Surprising Facts
1. From the analysis, it is suprising that the number of followers are not dependant on the repositories as the correlation between followers and repositories is low. 
2. Repository Creation and Bio Length Both Positively Impact Followers.People with longer bio are more expressive than the rest and they attract more followers. 

# 3. Recommendation
1. While the correlation between followers and repositories is low, creating more repositories does have a positive slope in gaining followers.
2. On an average, each additional word in the user's bio correlates with roughly 9 additional followers. This suggests that users with more descriptive bios might be more appealing or relatable to other users, helping them attract more followers.
