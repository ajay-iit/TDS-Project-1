# This is the first project in TDS which is about GitHub Users in city Austin

## 1. Data Collection
The 2 files scraped from the GitHub API using pandas code:
users.csv (contains data about GitHub users in Austin with over 100 followers and their repositories) 
repositories.csv(Contains information about 41123 public repositories from these users).

## 2. Surprising Facts 
Repository Creation and Bio Length Both Positively Impact Followers.People with longer bio are more expressive than the rest and they attract more followers. Also, a significant number of followers don't use wiki for their projects.

## 3. Recommendation
Developers should utilize wiki for better collaboration thereby increasing work efficiency. And, on an average, each additional word in the user's bio correlates with roughly 9 additional followers. So, users with more descriptive bios might be more appealing or relatable to other users, helping them attract more followers.
