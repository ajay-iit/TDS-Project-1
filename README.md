# This is the first project in TDS which is about GitHub Users in city Austin

## 1. Data Collection
Two files users.csv (contains data about GitHub users in Austin with over 100 followers and their repositories) and repositories.csv (Contains information about public repositories from these users) are scraped from the GitHub API using pandas code.

## 2. Surprising Facts 
Repository creation and bio length both positively impact followers as people with longer bio are more expressive than the rest and they attract more followers and  also, a significant number of followers don't use wiki for their projects.

## 3. Recommendation
Developers should utilize wiki for better collaboration thereby increasing work efficiency. And, on an average, each additional word in the user's bio correlates with roughly 9 additional followers. So, users with more descriptive bios might be more appealing or relatable to other users, helping them attract more followers.
